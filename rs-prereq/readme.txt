In this prerequisites test, I mainly learned about the solana development using rust
and using crates such as solana-program solana-client solana-sdk and how to call
custom program using rust.

I learnt about how to create a keypair using sdk and thier Types, convert between
types such as legacy uint8array and base58 formats.

Further creating a rpc client, creating instructions (transfer and custom ones) and
transactions and hence sending those transactions using client.
